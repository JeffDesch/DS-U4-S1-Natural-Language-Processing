to work independently and execute a research plan with minimal oversight ability to organize and synthesize analyses and communicate data insights with clarity  about the team  the policy economics team conducts rigorous research that places our business and driverpartners in the context of the economies in which uber operates our mission is to help people both inside and outside uber understand the unique nature of our independent work model and how it interacts with the wider world of work for example we know that the flexible work model is very valuable to uber drivers see chen et al angrist et al and that dynamic pricing is vital in protecting the health and efficiency of the dispatch market see castillo et al    surge pricing solves the wild goose chase    however it   s likely that consistency eg of pricing or earnings also carries some value for riders and drivers what values should we put on these opposing

Do you notice any difference in the results?\n"," - Watch Josh Starmer's video [StatQuest: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Step-by-Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ). Or read [Daniela Witten's tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/womeninstat/status/1285610321747611653?lang=en) on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Now go back and review the section \"Can we visualize word vectors?\" from the [lecture video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QuwkO2Uj5sONFtqCk0_d2zrks2I6stkN/view?usp=sharing). Write a brief description of your understanding of Principal Components Analysis, and how it was used to visualize word vectors. Do your own experiments to explore relationships of words in two dimensions. Write a summary of what you discovered.\n","\n"," - Try different visualizations for words and frequencies - what story do you want to tell with the data?\n"," - Scrape Job Listings for the job title \"Data Analyst\". How do these differ from Data Scientist Job Listings?\n"," - Try and identify requirements for experience specific technologies that are asked for in the job listings. Hint: compose a query that references a number of tech stack items. How are those items distributed among the job listings?\n"," - Use a clustering algorithm to cluster documents by their most important terms. Do the clusters reveal any common themes?\n","  - **Hint:** K-means might not be the best algorithm for this; algorithms that depend on Euclidean distance break down with high dimensional data. Do a bit of research to see if you can identify a suitable clustering algorithm.\n"," - Create a labeled dataset - which jobs will you apply for? Train a model to select the jobs you are most likely to apply for."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":132,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["#Part Six but with spacy\n","word_embed =
